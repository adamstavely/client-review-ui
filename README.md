## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd client-review-ui
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Update `.env` with your API URL (if using real API):
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:4000`

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Base URL for the backend API | `http://localhost:3000` |

**Note**: If the API is not available or `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is not set, the app automatically uses mock mode.

## How It Works

### Mock Mode vs Real API

The application intelligently switches between mock and real API modes:

1. **Mock Mode** (Default):
   - Uses in-memory data stored in `src/mockData.js`
   - No backend required
   - Perfect for development and testing
   - All functionality works without an API

2. **Real API Mode**:
   - Connects to backend API at `VITE_API_BASE_URL`
   - Requires running backend server
   - Automatically detects API availability

### Mode Detection Logic

The app checks for API availability:
- If `forceMockMode` is set to `'true'` in localStorage → Mock mode
- If `forceMockMode` is set to `'false'` → Real API mode
- Otherwise, attempts to ping `/health` endpoint
- If API is unreachable → Falls back to mock mode

### Mock Data Storage

Mock data is stored in browser memory during the session. To persist data across refreshes, you can use localStorage (not currently implemented).

## Routes

| Route | Component | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `/` | `UploadPage` | Upload files and view demo review links |
| `/review/:id` | `ReviewPage` | Main review interface with preview and comments |
| `/review/:id/preview` | `FullScreenPreview` | Full-screen preview in new tab |
| `/admin` | `AdminDashboard` | Admin panel for managing all review links |

## Components

### Core Components

#### `FileUpload.vue`

- Optional password protection
- File preview with size display
- Password visibility toggle
- Generates full review URL on success

#### `CommentsSidebar.vue`
- Unified comments interface
- Add new comments with type selection
- View threaded comments and replies
- Reply to comments
- Mark comments as resolved/unresolved
- Auto-updates on comment submission
- Read-only mode for completed reviews

#### `VersionSelector.vue`

- **`ConfirmModal.vue`**: Confirmation dialogs with custom messages
- **`PromptModal.vue`**: Text input prompts (with password visibility toggle)
- **`DatePickerModal.vue`**: Date selection for expiration override

## Key Functionality

### Upload & Publish Flow

1. User selects or drags a file onto the upload card
2. Optionally enters a password
3. Clicks "Upload & Publish"
4. File is uploaded (mock or real API)
5. Review link is generated and displayed
6. Full URL is shown for easy sharing

### Review Flow

1. Access review via link (`/review/:id`)
2. If password-protected, enter password
3. View design in preview pane
4. Switch between versions using dropdown
5. Add comments with type classification
6. Reply to comments
7. Mark comments as resolved
8. Optionally open in full-screen preview

### Designer Actions (on Demo Links)

Designers can perform these actions via icon buttons with tooltips:

- **Mark as Completed** (✓): Disables the review link, preserves comments
- **Change Password** (🔑): Update or remove password protection
- **Extend Expiration** (📅): Extends expiration by 30 days
- **Upload New Version** (⬆️): Add a new version to the review

### Admin Dashboard

- **View All Links**: Table showing all review links with metadata
- **Batch Selection**: Select multiple links for batch operations
- **Actions** (per link):
  - Copy review URL
  - Extend expiration (7 days)
  - Override expiration (custom date)
  - Reset password
  - Delete link
- **Bulk Delete**: Delete selected links at once
- **Filtering**: View all links including expired ones

### Comment System

- **Comment Types**:
  - General Feedback
  - Bug Report
  - Design Suggestion
  - Approval
  - Request Changes

- **Features**:
  - Threaded replies
  - Resolution tracking
  - Version-specific comments
  - Auto-refresh on new comments
  - Read-only mode for completed reviews

### Expiration Management

- **Expiration Display**:
  - Red: Expired (shows expiration date)
  - Orange: Expiring within 7 days
  - Gray: Active (more than 7 days remaining)

- **Extension Options**:
  - Quick extend: 30 days (demo links)
  - Custom extend: 7 days (admin dashboard)
  - Override: Custom date (admin dashboard)

## Development

### Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Runs on `http://localhost:4000` (configurable in `vite.config.js`)

### Code Style

- Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>`
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vuetify components for UI elements
- Path alias `@/` for `src/` directory

### Adding New Features

1. Create components in `src/components/`
2. Add routes in `src/router/index.js`
3. Update mock data in `src/mockData.js` if needed
4. Ensure both mock and real API modes work

### Mock Data

Mock data is stored in `src/mockData.js`:
- `mockReviews`: Array of review objects
- `mockAdminLinks`: Array of admin link objects
- `mockAPI`: Object with API simulation functions

To modify mock data, edit `src/mockData.js` directly.

## Build & Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Outputs to `dist/` directory.

### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

### Deployment Considerations

1. Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to production API URL
2. Ensure backend API is running and accessible
3. Configure CORS on backend if needed
4. Use environment-specific builds for different environments

### Port Configuration

Default port: `4000` (configured in `vite.config.js`)

To change the port, modify `server.port` in `vite.config.js`:
```javascript
server: {
  port: 4000,  // Change this
  host: true
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Mock Mode Not Working

- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure `mockData.js` is properly imported
- Verify localStorage doesn't have `forceMockMode: 'false'`

### API Connection Issues

- Verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env`
- Check backend API is running
- Check CORS settings on backend
- App will automatically fall back to mock mode if API is unreachable

### Styling Issues

- Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured
- Check `tailwind.config.js` content paths
- Verify CSS import order in `main.js` (Vuetify first, then Tailwind)
